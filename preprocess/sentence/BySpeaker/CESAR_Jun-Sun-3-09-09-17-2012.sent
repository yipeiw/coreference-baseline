okay so I put the other one up here it's okay.
yes.
okay.
that's fine.
so day one you just finished settling into your hotel room and you're free this afternoon to explore the city ask your car assistant for some suggestions and pick one I'm sorry what was the name of the assistant or can I just.
my name's Ian so yes.
say.
assistant.
hello Ian.
hi there.
hi I'm free this afternoon so I want to explore Moffett Field do you have any suggestions.
so Moffett Field there's a few interesting or unique places one is the Moffett Field airport this is where when Obama flies into San Francisco he actually lands there we've also got the NASA museum we've got a bowling alley and then there's also a commissary which is a supermarket for the military that live on base.
okay let's let's go to the commissary I've never seen a military commissary before so.
okay.
why don't we head over there it's quite close by.
okay how do I get there Ian.
let's just pull out of the car park and turn to the right I.
okay.
know it's your your first time here so I'll give you detailed directions.
okay is it out of park true.
we'll turn right out the car park and then continue right turn right again yes.
here.
you see the big hangar in front of us now.
okay.
and we'll continue down towards that.
okay.
okay we'll actually Google is actually paying to renovate this at the moment.
I actually saw a news story about that.
okay I haven't seen the news story just.
well it was actually not necessarily the hangar but it was talking about okay so just continue straight.
straight.
how how Google had kind of a inside track on renting the airport here.
yes.
and that some nonprofits wanted to rent space here but were not allowed by nan- NASA and it was simply because the the price for renting was so high that only Google was able to do it and.
want to continue straight and then turn to the left.
to the left alright supposedly you're suppose to rent it you need to have some sort of scientific reason to rent it.
yes.
but so Google was apparently just doing the minimal amount of scientific work.
ohh turn left here.
just to rent it for the private airport for all their C level employees and there was a big hoopla about it and so so continue straight.
we'll go straight.
what's that burning.
that's it's.
ohh it's the.
the heating duct I hope.
so we can pull this is the commissary here so we want to pull in.
ohh okay.
to the right.
to the right.
into the car park let's find a find a place to park the airport's very con- I mean it's very convenient for Google.
yes and they were saying that they were using it just as a private airport.
exactly.
instead of.
instead of driving ten minutes down the road to Palo Alto.
yeah.
yeah.
let's pull inside the car park up here.
yeah.
okay here we go.
okay seems quite busy today actually so.
considering on a Sunday this commissary is interestingly busy okay so it looks like I'm at the commissary thank you Ian.
no problem.
okay that's three we also have errands to run first up you want to send a postcard home to your spouse go to the post office next okay so Ian I'm I I need to go to the post office how do I get there from here.
we can't quite see it but it's only about a minute one block that way.
okay.
so let's pull out of the car park and.
good.
I picked a very busy place to go I should have picked maybe the bowling alley maybe Sundays.
it's probably not when.
you picked the busy.
yeah.
place.
didn't know Sunday breakfast was that big of a.
Sunday shopping.
yeah.
so we want to turn right here yup.
do I go.
right again.
alright into this here.
we probably want to pull onto the.
sorry.
onto the road.
either way would work just continue up to the stop signs and the post office is just up near here.
so make.
right here we want to make a.
right.
right.
at the stop sign.
we can see the post office right in front of us.
ohh okay.
so we'll just pull into the car park.
so make a left here.
yes make a left and.
I'm at the post office.
pull in again.
okay.
post office isn't very busy on a Sunday morning.
yep okay.
lights are on.
okay so thank you Ian going to the next one now I want to go to the gym okay Ian I need to go to the gym right now how do I get there from here.
okay the gym is back near the hotel actually so let's head back that way if you need to do a pull out of the car park I think the pull the way you came in was a one way so we need to go out the exit.
okay.
we'll just up over here somewhere.
okay.
then we'll turn right and then we continue straight for about three blocks.
okay yeah about the Google airport that supposedly there was a they're saying that it's unfair that they're getting Google there and other nonprofits can't use it and they're not really using it for scientific research they're using it as a airport.
okay it seems like we have a.
ohh.
your gas is low.
okay.
so we should go and pick up some gas before we get to the gym.
okay so.
so please turn left here.
left okay.
pull over to the gas stand which is the green building over there.
okay.
so just continue straight and there's a yellow fence if you see it coming up.
okay.
just past the fence turn right and we'll pull into a gas stand and and there's a number of pumps up here some where okay we'll fill it up.
I'm assuming this is a pump.
yes.
okay so I get out and I pump my gas.
or I'd get out and pump your gas I'm your assistant.
ohh okay.
okay thank you Ian so thanks for.
let's go back to the gym.
pumping.
okay so how do how do I get back to the gym now.
pull out this way and around this do sort of a U-turn around this.
okay.
okay.
mobile building.
okay.
pull out over here some where back onto the main road.
so do I make a left here.
make a left yes.
good that I picked a Sunday there's little to no traffic.
just squirrels and rabbits running around yes so continue straight through this intersection now if we just slow down here the the gym is on our left and we'll pull into this car park just just before the one way sign.
yeah.
okay okay.
okay I hope you enjoy your workout.
okay so I'm do my workout next task is after gym I want some McDonald's drive-through on the way back to the hotel go to McDonald's get some take out go back to hotel enjoy a good night's sleep okay so I'm done with my gym and I want to now go to McDonald's how do I get there from here Ian.
so there's only one fast food place on in Moffett Field.
yeah.
and it's just back actually quite close to the gas stands let's.
ohh okay.
head back that way we're on a one way street again.
okay.
we'll we'll pull out here I think yes.
okay and do I make turn.
we.
take a left.
left here okay there's a swimming pool here too.
a swimming pool and a tennis court as well.
wow.
so we want to turn right at this intersection.
the only problem is everything looks like it's from the nineteen fifties here.
well actually it.
the buildings.
was all built.
in the nineteen.
okay.
fifties.
so.
looks like they didn't change it for sixty years.
sixty seventy years.
yes.
okay right here.
it's slowly being updated but and we'll just slow down and turn into the car park here.
wow.
we are at McDonald's.
it actually makes it look like actually a real McDonald's.
it was so if we just pull up this way.
okay.
and the drive-through is just here so we.
okay.
pull up and do a U-turn.
okay.
we can order here.
okay so we order my Big Mac and cheese okay so I'm done.
so shall I guide you back to the hotel.
yes I just ordered so I need to go back to the hotel how do I get there from here.
do you know how to get there.
I do not can you show me how to get there.
so we head up this way and take the same route back to the gym and then the hotel.
okay is that the fastest way is there a quicker way.
that is the fastest way.
okay so I want to eat my burger when it's still hot.
so turn right here.
wow yeah real places that look like a bank and look like.
that's a space portal.
yeah it looks like a bank though.
I think it might have been at one point and turn left here.
it's like a get I know this sounds weird but it looks like I seen movies about like they do nuclear testing and.
yes.
they.
make.
fake towns.
that blow up it looks like that it's like an abandoned fake town to do nuclear testing on.
well they're doing nuclear testing in the fifties so.
ohh yeah.
this could actually be the start of what they were doing.
well I'm assuming they'll usually only do that in deserts and.
yes.
not.
populated areas.
we'll turn right in here back into the car park okay we missed that intersection loop around.
ohh we missed it okay I'm sorry.
okay so we just go around here.
yes.
okay so.
so your hamburger is cooling down but turn left at this intersection.
too busy talking and not paying attention okay.
it's not that keep an eye on your speed the speed limit here is twenty five miles per hour.
okay you said go here right on the left lane.
yes.
and we'll turn left then we'll go straight and then we'll take the first left into the car park.
okay.
and it's a one way so we need to turn right here.
okay just park in any of these spaces here.
we'll park anywhere here.
okay okay.
okay.
okay what's that sound ohh okay.
I'm not sure yes.
task four.
hope you have a good evening.
okay so I had a good night I woke up this is day two your colleague Phil Collison arrived last night and you offered him a ride to his meeting room on the way to your own meeting drop off Phil at his meeting at the army barracks before going to your meeting at Crown Start-Up okay Ian good morning.
good morning.
I need to drive Phil to his meeting at the army barracks how do I get there from here.
to the army barracks let's get out of the car park first that's.
okay.
right and we'll I'll guide you there.
okay.
so the back towards the McDonald's.
okay okay.
so go driving around the car park.
okay do I make a left or right here.
gonna make a left.
okay.
there's no right I think the car parks are more confusing than the roadways here we just want to be careful because there's quite a bump here.
okay.
good.
and at the exit we want to turn to the left.
surprising they don't have a stop sign there at the intersection.
yeah it's not an intersection I.
yeah.
think.
it's just a li-.
it's just a.
it's a driveway.
ohh okay.
officially so.
so just continue straight here.
continue straight up until the stop sign.
okay.
and then we'll turn to the right.
okay okay.
and continue straight and we'll turn right into this car park.
okay okay so these the army barracks here.
yes.
okay so I stop.
pull up here and Phil can jump out.
okay thank you Phil see you later and so Ian I need to get to the Crown Start-Up funds.
okay.
how do I get there from here.
Crown Start-Up Funds is on the other side of Moffett Field.
okay.
so we'll head out and turn to the right and take the expressway to the other side of town.
it's interesting you call car parks and expressways.
yes.
I think.
it's very European.
it is.
instead of parking lots and freeway.
exactly.
so make a.
I'm a European agent we want to turn the left.
ohh to the left here.
here.
yes.
okay.
so I think that that the the final thing that happened with Google is that they they gave a large in addition to paying they gave a rather large donation to restore that big hangar in fact a they had I mean they had to take all of the asbestos out and this was a no one has has used it for the last ten years or something apparently because it's carcinogen and so that made NASA happier so that.
grease the.
they could restore the.
wheels I guess.
old so we'll turn left here.
okay.
so the speed limit in this area is thirty five.
okay I guess it made financial sense for both both sides that way I mean the free clean up for NASA and.
so I just heard that there's a car accident up ahead so we're going to have to change our route.
ohh okay.
so how bout we turn left here and we'll take the inner route.
okay.
to Crown Start-Up Funds okay so we just keep going straight up to the.
straight.
okay.
stop sign at the end of this road and we turn into the right if you remember this is this is going back past the McDonald's no it's okay so the Crown Start-Up Funds is actually back towards the post office.
McDonald's.
okay.
so we'll turn right here and continue straight all the way to the end of this road all the way to the far trees.
okay.
so Google's expanding as well I've seen that the one of the big Hewlett Pa Packard campus is out here which was Hewlett Packard sold a year or two ago is just now it's being converted into a Google.
wow.
campus I guess.
gonna own most of Mountain View one of these days.
perhaps yeah might end up like Toyota it'll be called ma- Google.
yeah it's.
city name.
yeah in Japan I you know they have entire cities that are pretty much owned by by car manufacturers or industrial companies.
but there's Toyota which is Toyota.
yes.
Toyota city which is Toyota the things are changing it looks like so we'll turn.
left here.
left here.
yeah.
this is a little bit creepy it's almost like a full size city but it's abandoned like I said it's like like those new.
we turn.
into this one way.
ohh.
street.
one way.
just after the fire hydrant.
okay.
it's it's like I said kind of like the nuclear testing cities.
but in slightly better condition.
yeah.
like with new cars empty cars so we'll turn over here next to that green car.
yeah.
okay.
would probably be a good place to park so Crown Start-Up Funds is in this building just here.
okay.
okay.
okay.
good luck for your meeting.
okay thank you so I'm done with my meeting okay you have very success you had a very successful meeting at Crown Crown Start-Up Funds they offered you a start up of one million dollars you have half and hour before your next meeting at Nanotech Technical Industries make your make it to your known to your meeting at Nanotech on time okay I have half an hour to get to Nanotech but since I rather be early Ian I might as well just drive there from here how do I get there from here.
okay.
so Nanotechnologies is actually just over the other side of the car park.
okay.
while you were in your meeting you had a text message.
okay.
so you received a text message from Sam McGee how did your meeting go I'll be at my house this afternoon if you want to meet up the address is seven fourteen McCoon.
okay since I have half and hour let's Ian let's go to Sam McGee's home at.
four seventeen McCoon.
so four seventeen McCoon let's how do I get there from there.
go over there.
so head out the car park to your left.
okay.
and it's only a couple of minutes away so you'll if you don't stay there too long you'll definitely make it in time for your meeting shall I send a message to Sam to tell him you're coming.
okay.
yes can you text him back saying that I'll be there in five minutes.
okay.
you want to go to the end of this car park and then we'll turn to the left.
okay.
so we'll just take it slowly here 'cause it's another.
there's another bump here.
bump yes.
not clearly marked.
it's not.
okay.
and we'll turn to the right.
wow these trees are really really green.
they are and we want to turn and get into the other lane.
okay.
and if we turn in here to your left.
okay.
into the community area okay and there's a right at the first intersection here now you've got an incoming message from your an urgent message from your colleague Phil Collison.
okay.
the vice president just got here and I left the quarterly report in your back seat I need you to drop it off as soon as possible.
okay so let's first text back Sam McGee saying that I won't be able to make it.
okay.
and let's you know go back to the army barracks.
okay.
in.
yes.
the army barracks that's me how do I get to the army barracks from here.
that's.
correct.
so we'll continue straight.
fastest way.
and well have to continue the continue on this road for a few minutes okay and I'll send that message off to Sam.
okay.
and should I tell Phil that you're on your way.
yes please text him saying that I'll be there in.
go straight.
five minutes as well to drop off his.
so I think you'll actually be there in three but I'll send that off.
okay let him know I'll be there in three minutes.
a incoming message from Phil.
okay.
thanks a lot I I'll be waiting for you at the front door.
okay.
I think there's a lot of irrigation at this part of on Moffett Field that's why the trees are so green.
this these all look like brand new homes.
they do.
there's a lot of speed bumps.
yes so up at this first stop sign we'll turn to the right or turn to the left I mean.
so are all these people that live here NASA or military employees.
these are mainly military employees.
okay.
and there is some there's a bit of a blurred line between NASA and military.
okay.
so that we space as well which is there's military research military activity on that.
ohh and military are they air force army navy.
I think there's both air force and army so there's a army group here as well.
okay so continue straight.
we'll continue straight watch out for the squirrel.
squirrel.
now turn to the right just after the stop sign.
ohh after.
the stop sign okay.
continue around to the army barracks we want to go up to the end of to the first stop sign and then turn to the right ohh so you've got an incoming message from Sam.
okay.
too bad we couldn't catch up how about we hit up for dinner tonight are you free.
yeah.
want to turn right here.
yeah if you can email back Sam saying that I'll be free tonight what time is good for you.
okay I'll send that off to Sam gonna want to continue straight here.
ohh so go straight okay.
and again up just past the fire hydrant we'll turn into the car park over here me army barracks.
okay so I see Phil and gonna drop off his report good luck Phil okay so I'm I'm done now and.
okay I see we've only.
I think I should go back to.
got a.
five minutes until your meeting at Nanotech so.
let's Ian what's the fastest way to get back to Nanotech.
so we'll head out and we'll go down the expressway again.
okay.
see that there's they cleaned up the accident so it's open.
that was right when was I gonna ask I was gonna hope that the accident was clear so make a left up here.
yes.
ohh is this a baseball field or something there.
yeah so there's a baseball field there's people who do shot put and some athletic activities.
oh.
wow this land must be amazing property value here that's a lot of open land I'm very surprised that Mountain View has this much open land here.
it just seems like.
they.
have a.
big golf course and yes.
wow that's.
but we're not officially in California now so.
right.
yeah so is this considered I guess like army sovereign land or something I guess.
we want to turn left here this is federal land so it's actually under Washington Washington D C jurisdiction.
ohh wow okay.
so don't get drive speeding California speeding tickets here you get federal ones which are which are a federal offense.
great so if you screw up here you go to you go federal prison not state prison.
straight here.
exactly.
ohh.
so it's not a stop sign you can continue down towards the hangar so the guards at the front gates are armed as well and it's if you forget your driver's license or ID they will not let you in.
ohh okay.
yeah it's looks like a something like a a court building almost.
yes so we turn to the right at the first corner here.
okay only bad thing here is there are lot of narrow roads.
there are.
and it and they're not well labeled.
no.
so continue straight.
continue straight and and then we'll turn left here.
okay so funny you have a con a pedestrian crossing in the middle of nowhere.
yeah.
so continue straight.
we'll keep going straight.
okay.
and when we get to the stop sign up here we want to turn to the right.
okay.
now we turn into the car park up here.
okay.
Nanotech is the building with the large antenna on the roof.
okay.
and just park in front of that.
got a one way thing there again not well labeled.
I know.
okay let's park right here okay so I'm at Nano.
okay good luck for your meeting.
okay got another one your meeting at Nanotech was uneventful okay go back to the hotel to wash up for dinner okay so I'm done with the meeting so Ian how do I get back to the hotel.
just before you head off I got an e- a message from Sam while you were at your meeting.
and Sam said seven PM sounds good for dinner how about I stop by your hotel and we head out to a good Mexican place that I know nearby.
okay Ian please text him back saying seven PM would be fine I'll meet you in front of the hotel at seven PM.
okay and there was one other message from Phil Collins thank you very much for dropping off the report it was critically needed how bout we head out for dinner tonight to celebrate.

and looking at Facebook they're not friends on Facebook at the moment but they might be after this evening.
okay.
okay so I'll guide you back to the hotel.
okay.
and we'll do head up here in this car park and then go around perhaps.
okay.
okay so turn here and actually then make a tight right.
okay.
and we exit the car park to your right.
like I said these are very poorly labeled streets and very narrow.
we turn to the left.
the curbs are so low too it's don't know where the road ends and the curb begins sometimes.
exactly continue around here and keeping to the left slightly.
okay do I keep to the left.
left here.
over.
here okay.
yes.
just continue straight.
and we continue straight.
okay.
and we'll continue straight again going to turn left here.
straight.

okay.
back at the hotel.
okay do I park up here.
